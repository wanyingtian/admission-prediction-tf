Deep Learning Regression with Admissions Data

## Project Overview
Create a deep learning regression model that predicts the likelihood that a student applying to graduate school will be accepted based on various application factors (such as test scores).

By analyzing the parameters in this graduate admissions dataset, you will use TensorFlow with Keras to create a regression model that can evaluate the chances of an applicant being admitted. 

I hope this will give you further insight into the graduate admissions world and improve my test prep strategy.
## About Dataset
Dataset Source [Graduate Admission] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions?select=Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv)

#### Content
The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.
The parameters included are :

GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
University Rating ( out of 5 )
Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )
Acknowledgements
This dataset is inspired by the UCLA Graduate Dataset. The test scores and GPA are in the older format.
The dataset is owned by Mohan S Acharya.
